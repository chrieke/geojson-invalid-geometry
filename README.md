**List of GeoJSON geometry issues with example files**

Ever encountered an *invalid geometry* error when dealing with GeoJSON? Even if a GeoJSON conforms to the
[GeoJSON specification](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7946), some tools or APIs might have issues with it.
This repo shows the common issues when handling GeoJSON geometries and how to fix them.
For a general introduction to GeoJSON see [here](https://macwright.com/2015/03/23/geojson-second-bite.html).

## Invalid by GeoJSON specification

### Polygon with less than 4 nodes
A [Polygon's](https://macwright.com/2015/03/23/geojson-second-bite.html#polygons) exterior ring (shell) and
inner ring (hole) must have four or more coordinate positions (also called nodes or vertices). In order to define an
area (compared to a line) at least three positions are required, plus the first and last node must be the same to close
the Polygon (see below). 
[Spec](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7946#section-3.1.6),
[Example](polygon/polygon_less_than_four_nodes.geojson)

### Unclosed Polygon 
The first and last node of a Polygons exterior or inner ring must be the same with identical values. This signifies the
start and endpoint of a closed Polygon. 
[Spec](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7946#section-3.1.6),
[Example](polygon/polygon_unclosed_polygon.geojson)

### Polygon has duplicate nodes
From the closed Polygon requirement (see above), results that no two other positions of the exterior or interior
ring can be the same, as then the start/endpoint of the ring could not be identified. 
[Spec](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7946#section-3.1.6), 
[Example](polygon/polygon_has_duplicate_nodes.geojson)

### Polygon has wrong winding order
A Polygon's or MultiPolygons exterior ring must have counterclockwise winding order, the inner ring (defines hole cutouts) must be
clockwise. This is according to the right-hand rule, which is often overlooked when manually creating Polygons or converting from other formats.
As an older specification version did not define the winding order, most tools will accept Polygons with invalid winding
order, but not all. 
[Spec](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7946#section-3.1.6),
[Example 1](polygon/polygon_exterior_ring_not_counterclockwise_winding_order.geojson),
[Example 2](polygon/polygon_inner_ring_not_clockwise_winding_order.geojson)

### Inner and exterior Polygon rings intersect or cross
The inner ring of a Polygon must not intersect or cross the exterior ring. Also no two inner rings
may intersect or cross each other. The inner and exterior ring, as well as two inner rings may touch at a single point
only.
[Example](polygon/fc_polygon_inner_and_exterior_ring_cross.geojson)

### Zero-length LineString
A Linestring with identical start and end node coordinates. A valid LineString contains two or more distinct positions.
[Spec](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7946#section-3.1.4),
[Example](linestring/linestring_zero_length.geojson)

## Valid, problematic for some tools/APIs 

### Polygon has holes
A Polygon is allowed to have hole cutouts, this is a feature, not an issue. However, some APIs don't accept
Polygon geometries with holes as input (e.g. some satellite data providers where the desired area is relevant for
pricing). The holes can be removed by removing the
Polygon's [inner ring](https://macwright.com/2015/03/23/geojson-second-bite.html#polygons) coordinates. 
[Example](polygon/polygon_has_holes.geojson)

### Polygon self-intersection
Here one or multiple parts of the geometry overlap another part of itself. Often found in complex geometry shapes,
after geometry operations without careful cleanup (buffer, raster-to-vector etc.).
A Polygon is allowed to have self-intersections, this is conform with the GeoJSON specification. However, it frequently
causes issues in downstream applications thus is often rejected by APIs and tools.

A common approach for removing the self-intersections is applying a zero-buffer operation (e.g. `.buffer(0)` in
shapely). This dissolves the overlapping areas and usually is an okay solution for small, undesired self-intersections.
However, especially for larger self-intersections this might lead to unintended changes of the geometry, as significant
parts of the geometry could be removed by the operation. Here only a manual operation can fix the issue, by splitting of
the geometry into multiple parts, or adding/removing nodes.
[Example 1](polygon/polygon_selfintersection_small.geojson) 
[Example 2](polygon/polygon_selfintersection_large.geojson)

### Coordinate reference system set
The GeoJSON specification defines all GeoJSON as being in the [WGS84](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System_1984)
coordinate reference system (CRS) with latitude / longitude decimal coordinates. Thus, the CRS does not need to be
specified in the GeoJSON. In older GeoJSON specifications you could define alternative crs, however this can lead to
interoparability issues with some tools/APIs if they ignore the crs definition and assume WGS84.
[Spec](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7946#section-4),
[Example](all_geometry_types/crs_defined.geojson)

### Wrong bounding box coordinate order
A `bbox` may be defined (but is not required) in the GeoJSON object to summarize the geometries on the Geometries,
Features, or FeatureCollections level. If it is defined, the bbox coordinate order must conform
to `[west, south, east, north]`.
[Spec](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7946#section-3),
[Example](all_geometry_types/wrong_bounding_box_coordinate_order.geojson)

### Excessive coordinate precision
Allthough not mandatory, the GeoJSON specification recommends a coordinate precision of 6 decimal places. Using more
than 6 decimal places may lead to issues with some tools/APIs and unncessarily increase the file size (6 decimal places
corresponds to about 10cm of a GPS).
[Spec](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7946#section-11.2),
[Example](all_geometry_types/excessive_coordinate_precision.geojson)

### Geometry crosses the antimeridian
A Polygon or LineString that extends across the 180th meridian can lead to interoparability issues, and instead
should be cut in two as a MultiPolygon or MultiLineString. Also
see ["The 180th Meridian"](https://macwright.com/2016/09/26/the-180th-meridian.html) by Tom MacWright.
[Spec](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7946#section-3.1.9),
[Example](all_geometry_types/geometry_crosses_the_antimeridian.geojson)

### 3D or more coordinates not accepted
A geometry's nodes/positions/vertices should consist of either two coordinates (order `[longitude, latitude]`) or three
coordinates (`[longitude, latitude, elevation]`). Elevation is optional. Some tools and APIs may not accept 3D coordinates.

In early versions of the GeoJSON specification, it was normal to store more than three coordinates, e.g. storing additional information like time etc. Technically still
allowed but [discouraged](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7946#section-3.1.1) by the current specification, if used in some
tools or APIs this may lead to errors or the additional values being ignored. The additional information should now be stored
separately in the properties of the feature.
[Example 1](all_geometry_types/3d_coordinates.geojson),
[Example 2](all_geometry_types/4d_coordinates.geojson)

### Incorrect geometry data type
For example, a geometry that can be identified as a Polygon by its shape, has the geometry `type` defined as another
type, e.g. LineString. Also when a single geometry object (e.g., Point, LineString or Polygon) has multiple, disconnected parts that should be
represented as a MultiPoint, MultiLineString or MultiPolygon.

### Multi-type Geometry with just one geometry object
A MultiPoint, MultiLineString or MultiPolygon should represent multiple geometries of the same type
(e.g. multiple Polygons within a MultiPolygon). While it is not invalid according to the GeoJSON specification, if
a Multi-type object only contains a single geometry object, some tools might complain.
[Example](all_geometry_types/multitype_geometry_with_just_one_geometry.geojson)

### Geometry or Feature not wrapped in a Feature or FeatureCollection
The GeoJSON specification allows not wrapping geometry or feature objects in a FeatureCollection,
see [spec](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7946#section-2). Any GeoJSON object on its own is still a valid GeoJSON. 
However, some tools might expect a Feature and FeatureCollection and the associated properties.

### Feature has no geometry
A GeoJSON Feature is allowed to be unlocated, meaning it has `null` as a geometry member, see
[spec](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7946#section-3.2). But some tools/APIs might expect a geometry and complain.
